# Healthcare Survey Exercise

This coding exercise focuses on a patient satisfaction survey system for healthcare facilities.

In this exercise, you will do pair programming with another software engineer. They will take on the role of a software engineer on your team.

In the pair programming paradigm, there are two roles: Driver and Navigator (see [this resource](https://www.industriallogic.com/pages/cheat-sheets/pdfs/Ensemble%20Programming%20Cheat%20Sheet.pdf)). You will be the *Navigator* and your pair engineer will be the *Driver*.

## Objectives

- Demonstrate effective communication about technical ideas
- Demonstrate technical expertise
- Use tests to drive new behavior, refactoring as necessary after each passing test
- Keep existing tests passing
- Use clean code and design patterns

## Part 1: Refactor the Existing Design

The current implementation of the survey aggregator has several code smells. Adding a new category requires changes in multiple places. Refactor the code to improve its design so that adding new categories in the future will require minimal changes.

## Part 2: Add New Survey Categories

Extend the survey system by adding support for two new categories that have been added to the survey system (specified here: [NEW_CATEGORIES_SPEC.md](NEW_CATEGORIES_SPEC.md)).
